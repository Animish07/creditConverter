# creditConverter
This project lets you convert you local university credits to ECTS standard.
While applying to various universities for my master's degree I came across the credit requiremnts of various courses, these usually follow ECTS format and as an indian student I wanted to find a simple solution for converting my local credits. 

Note:  This based on the system which is referenced from the university website of freie berlin, your university might use some other way of coversion, therefore make sure you consult with institute.
